Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Development, testing and maintenance of computer software. Ensures functionality and efficiency of software


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Birth of software engineering
Rise of object oriented programming
Agile manifesto and modern development


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning
Requirements collection and analysis
design
implementation
testing
deployment
maintenance


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is step by step while agile is flexible
waterfall testing is done after development while agile is continuous
waterfall is best for projects with fixed requirements while agile is most suitable for dynamic projects like mobile apps


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers design,build and maintain software
quality assurance engineer ensures the functionality of software by identifying bugs
project managers oversee the project timeline, budget and team coordination

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs enhance productivity by providing tools for coding, debugging and testing all in one place e.g visual studio code
VCS is a tool that tracks and manages changes to code, enabling collaboration and maintaining a history of efits e.g git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing complex codebases- using modular designs, following coding principles and using tools like IDEs
Debugging- using debuggers and following test-driven development
keeping up with new tech- dedication of time for continuous learning

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing- testing of individual components. ensures each unit works as expected
integration testing- testing how different modules work together. verifies that combined parts work correctly
system testing- tests the complete integrated system as a whole. confirms the whole system works as a whole in a real world environment
acceptance testing- tests whether the system meets individual or business requirements. ensures customer satisfaction and prevents post-release issues

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Process of coming up with and refining prompts for ai models for effectivity. improves accuracy, efficiency, productivity and unlocks the ai potential

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about software development.Briefly explain the main stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and their importance in building reliable software.By refining the prompt, you get a more relevant and structured response â€” exactly what you need without unnecessary information
